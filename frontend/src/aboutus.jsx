      <p>Welcome to Sub-Tracker! 
        This is David Contreras's first project using JavaScript.
        Using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend,
        this project aims to allow the user to easily cancel their subscriptions with the click of a button
        Using this project as a stepping-stone for further endeavors, 
        I aim to improve upon the knowledge I have gained throughout
        my time at Whittier College.
        Thank You.
      </p>
     
    </div>
