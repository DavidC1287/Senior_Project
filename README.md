# Senior_Project 

## Title: Sub-Tracker

### Track: Integrated Computer Science/Economics

#### Aim/Objective:
The goal of my senior project is to develop a user-friendly desktop application that will improve the users’ management of their subscription services. With helpful functions and features, the application will aim to streamline the subscription management process by allowing the user to view, modify, and cancel subscriptions. They will also be able to view what payment method is attached to what subscription. The overall objective of my application is to provide users with a complete solution that reduces the need to manually monitor their account statement and provides a seamless and easy-to-use approach to subscription management.

#### Background:
In recent years, subscription-based services have taken over the masses. Especially during the pandemic, we saw an increase in the number of subscription-based service users. These ranged from entertainment platforms such as streaming services, online memberships, as well as food delivery services and many more. However, as the number of subscriptions grows rapidly, people often struggle to maintain a record of what subscriptions they have. The issues can range from being unable to keep track of payment dates, struggling to remember what subscription is tied to what payment method, to even losing track of how many services one is paying for. Although not personally happening to me, I am familiar with individuals who do have this issue and they have informed me that it can be very wasteful of money. Trying to keep up with all of this without the assistance of an application is simply too tedious and time-consuming, which is why I am proposing my subscription application.

#### Scope:
This project will center around creating a versatile desktop application with the ultimate goal of streamlining subscriptions to services. Its implementation will involve intuitive functions and features aiming to streamline the subscription management process. Through this application, users will be able to seamlessly remove subscriptions with the push of a button along with having rapid access to vital information regarding their payment card details along with important payment due dates. Additionally, users will be able to view which payment card is linked to which subscription. The scope of this project will include the creation of a centralized platform where users can access vital subscription service information. By providing users with a comprehensive solution to a big problem in our society, my project aims to simplify the management of subscriptions and reduce the need to manually monitor one’s bank account to stay updated with these services.

#### Approach/Methodology:
My approach and methodology for this project integrate familiar and new techniques to develop an efficient desktop application for subscription management. Utilizing JavaScript for both the frontend and backend portions of the project, I am excited to delve into the world of full-stack development. The development process of my application will cover a combination of understanding and practical application. Through persistent online research, exploration of relevant documentation, and utilization of coding examples, I aim to acquire an understanding of JavaScript's capabilities for both frontend and backend development. Additionally, taking advantage of resources such as tutorials, forums, and online tutorials will provide valuable information and guidance throughout the development of my project.

#### Outcome:
My proposed project should produce palpable results and benefits once it is completed. Developing a desktop application for subscription management should provide users with a smooth and effective platform for subscription management. By the centralization of subscription information and adding functions such as viewing, modifying, and canceling subscriptions, users gain convenience and control over their finances. In addition to this, the implementation of this project will ensure the protection of user information and privacy. The ability for the users to display their payment card information and payment due dates allows them to have an even more comprehensive view of their subscription costs. This allows them to make informed financial management decisions. The impact of my application goes further than helping individual users; there could potentially be wider social benefits as a whole. Simplifying the subscription management process can reduce the amount of burden and stress associated with having to manually manage multiple subscriptions.
