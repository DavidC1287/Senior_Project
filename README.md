# Senior Project 2024 Proposal

## Title: Sub-Tracker

### Track: Integrated Computer Science/Economics

#### Aim/Objective:
The goal of my senior project is to develop a user-friendly desktop application that will improve the users’ management of their subscription services. With helpful functions and features, the application will aim to streamline the subscription management process by allowing the user to view, modify and cancel subscriptions. They will also be able to view what payment method is attached to what subscription. The goal is to create a centralized platform that allows users to easily access information vital to their subscription, including their bank card information and payment due dates, easing the burden of having to manage finances related to these services. The overall objective of my application is to provide users with a complete solution that reduces the need to manually monitor their account statement and provides a seamless and easy-to-use approach to subscription management. This project will aim to provide an efficient and user-friendly application to make the users’ lives easier.

#### Background:
In recent years, subscription-based services have taken over the masses. Especially during the pandemic, we saw an increase in the amount of subscription-based service users. These ranged from entertainment platforms such as streaming services, online memberships as well as food delivery services and many more. However, as the number of subscriptions grows rapidly, people often struggle to maintain a record of what subscriptions they have. The issues can range from being unable to keep track of payment dates, struggling to remember what subscription is tied to what payment method, to even losing track of how many services one is paying for. Although not personally happening to me, I am familiar with individuals who do have this issue and they have informed me that it can be very wasteful of money. Trying to keep up with all of this without the assistance of an application is simply too tedious and time-consuming, which is why I am proposing my subscription application.

#### Scope:
This project will center around creating a versatile desktop application with the ultimate goal of streamlining subscriptions to services. Its implementation will involve intuitive functions and features aiming to streamline the subscription management process. Through this application, users will be able to seamlessly remove subscriptions with the push of a button along with having rapid access to vital information regarding their payment card details along with important payment due dates. Additionally, users will be able to view which payment card is linked to which subscription. The scope of this project will include the creation of a centralized platform where users can access vital subscription service information. By providing users with a comprehensive solution to a big problem in our society, my project aims to simplify the management of subscriptions and reduce the need to manually monitor one’s bank account to stay updated with these services. The overall objective is to deliver a user-friendly but efficient service to the users of my application that enhances their overall experience and further streamlines subscription management in their daily lives.

#### Approach/Methodology:
My approach and methodology for this project integrate familiar and new techniques to develop an efficient desktop application for subscription management. Using my experience with C++ for the backend portion of the project, I will capitalize on the knowledge and skills acquired throughout my time at Whittier College. My familiarity with C++ which I have gained over the years will help me to navigate through the complexity of backend development effectively. For the frontend development portion, React JavaScript will be used to create a user-friendly interface. While I have limited experience with JavaScript, particularly in front-end development, I look forward to this opportunity as a chance to expand my skill set. Vast online research and utilization of JavaScript web development examples will assist as valuable resources in expanding my knowledge on the matter. I approach this project with passion and a commitment to strengthening my skills while learning new ones. The development process of my application will cover a combination of understanding and practical application. Through persistent online research, exploration of relevant documentation, and utilization of coding examples, I aim to acquire an understanding of JavaScript's frontend capabilities. Additionally, taking advantage of resources such as tutorials, forums, and online tutorials will provide valuable information and guidance throughout the development of my project. The project's development will be structured around flexible methodologies, emphasizing continued development, frequent feedback, and continuous improvement. I will utilize project management tools to stay organized, prioritize properly, and keep track of my work to ensure efficient progress and timely delivery of project deadlines. Quality assurance and testing will play a vital role in ensuring the reliability and functionality of my application. Continuous testing will be implemented to identify and address any potential issues in functionality. Throughout the project, I will maintain clear documentation to document the development process, including design decisions, implementation details, and troubleshooting strategies. This documentation will serve as a valuable resource for any future reference and knowledge transfer. In summary, my approach and methodology for this project embrace a combination of established knowledge I have gained throughout my years at Whittier College and new learning opportunities through structured and iterative development.

#### Outcome:
My proposed project should produce palpable results and benefits once it is completed. Developing a desktop application for subscription management should provide users with a smooth and effective platform for subscription management. By the centralization of subscription information and adding functions such as viewing, modifying and canceling subscriptions, users gain convenience and control over their finances. In addition to this, the implementation of this project will ensure the protection of user information and privacy. The ability for the users to display their payment card information and payment due dates allows them to have an even more comprehensive view of their subscription costs. This allows them to make informed financial management decisions. The impact of my application goes further than helping individual users, there could potentially be wider social benefits as a whole. Simplifying the subscription management process can reduce the amount of burden and stress associated with having to manually manage multiple subscriptions. This in turn can improve the user’s overall well-being. Additionally, by emphasizing a user-centered and friendly design, satisfaction and the adopted use of my application should grow if it were ever put to market. The combination of feedback gained from troubleshooting on my own, sharing my application with peers and implementing improvements as I go, the application will hopefully evolve and grow as changes are needed and user preferences change, ensuring its viability and relevance. Overall, my application should result in a better user experience, better management of subscriptions and better decision-making and social benefits regarding subscription management. By focusing on realistic results, the project aims to deliver tangible value to users, ultimately contributing to a more efficient and streamlined subscription management experience.
